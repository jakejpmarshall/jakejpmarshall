# Hello, my name is Jake

### I am an outdoorsman from Idaho now living in Colorado. For six seasons, I guided whitewater rafts on the Arkansas River, but I want to transition to a technical career. So, I took Bloomtech's Data Science course. In the past, I have also worked in modular home manufacuring as a suceessful manager on the factroy line. Both roles pushed me to develop strong communication and leadership skills. I am currently sarching for roles in Data Science.
